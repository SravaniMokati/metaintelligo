According to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), India is increasing its focus on developing long-range nuclear weapons. This shift in strategy is driven by tensions and perceived threats from neighboring countries like China and Pakistan. The report highlights that while Pakistan remains India's primary concern, India is placing more emphasis on longer-range weapons capable of reaching targets in China. The SIPRI report also states that several countries, including India, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel, are modernizing their nuclear arsenals and introducing new nuclear-capable weapon systems. It is noted that India recently conducted a successful test flight of a new-generation ballistic missile called "Agni Prime."
