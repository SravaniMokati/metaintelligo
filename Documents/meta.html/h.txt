there is a boy name called krish.

one night when a normal school boy called krish was walking down the street, thinking about the 50 overs cricket match he would playing tomarrow at the ground. suddenly he founded a bat on the road.he picked up it and noticed it was a old cricket bat and rusty  but very easy to swing.
so the next day he got the woden bat he had found yesterday to use in the final cricket match of the season.his other new and shine bat always had made him lose , so he decided to use this old and rusty one, not his new and shiney one.
but krish dont know about the bat . the bat was magical bat . krish reached the stadium .the pitch colour is green . green pitches having green grass on it makes it less abrasive on the ball and helps the ball to swing easily.filders and umpire , all cricketers are in there position .umpire blew the wistle. he swung the bat.he thought the ball would hit the stumps like how it always happened when he used the old bat. but this time he whacked it for a 6. how amazing was that krish thought. he kept smashing 4's& 6's until the umpire said they have already finished their balls. the crowd calling krish krish.... with lots of love and happiness. cheer girls is cheering very entusiastically krish .
when it time to oponent team to bat , it was the home-team ...krish team got all their players out quickly. they weren't very good with all out for 340 runs. the high scores for krish's team was, krish which got 243 runs for only 55 balls and opponent high scored was their captain called mitch which got 155 runs for 137 balls and there hight score was 57 for 60 balls.

after the game krish's teammates cheered to him for making them win the final match of the season. krish's coach also congratulated him. krish was also man of the match .
